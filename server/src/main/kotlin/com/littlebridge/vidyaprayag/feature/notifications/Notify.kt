/*
 * File: Notify.kt
 * Module: feature.notifications
 *
 * The single write-path for the cross-user notification spine (RA-41/42/46/50).
 * Every trigger that should reach a user — student absent → parent, marks
 * published → parent, homework assigned → class parents, announcement posted →
 * parents+teachers, leave applied/decided, link-child decided, fee status
 * change — calls Notify.* so notifications are created consistently, with the
 * originating school_id carried for tenant isolation.
 *
 * MULTI-TENANCY: every row stores `schoolId`. Recipients are resolved by the
 * caller (which already holds a school-scoped context) and we never fan out
 * across schools — the caller passes only in-tenant recipient ids.
