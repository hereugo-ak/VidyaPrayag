/*
 * File: TeacherAccess.kt
 * Module: core
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Single source of truth for TEACHER-side authorization & scoping, mirroring
 *   SchoolAccess.kt. Master rebuild doc gap G1 mandates: "every teacher endpoint
 *   filters by teacher_id ∈ JWT and the requested class_id must belong to that
 *   teacher's assignments; reject otherwise with 403".
 *
 *   This module centralizes:
 *     - principal parsing (UUID) reusing core/SecurityModule
 *     - school + role resolution straight from app_users (not the JWT claim, so a
 *       role change takes effect on the next request and a forged claim can't
 *       widen access)
 *     - a guard that requires an authenticated TEACHER with a school
 *     - an assignment-scope check so a teacher can only read/write the classes
 *       they are actually assigned to (teacher_subject_assignments)
 *
 * The `classId` exchanged with the client (TeacherClassDto.id) is the
 * teacher_subject_assignments row id. Every scoped endpoint resolves that id
 * back to its assignment, asserts it belongs to the caller's school AND is
 * assigned to the caller (by teacher_id OR teacher_name fallback), and only then
 * trusts its className / section / subject.
 *
 * Usage in a route handler:
 *   val ctx = call.requireTeacherContext() ?: return@get          // 401/403/404 itself
 *   val asg = call.requireOwnedAssignment(ctx, classId) ?: return@get  // 400/403/404 itself
 *   // asg.className, asg.section, asg.subject are now trusted
