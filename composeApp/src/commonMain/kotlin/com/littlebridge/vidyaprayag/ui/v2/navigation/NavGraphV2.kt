/**
 * NavGraphV2 — the single source of nav truth for the `ui/v2` entry experience (PHASE 7).
 *
 * This is the Compose translation of the target entry flow. Navigation is **state-driven** (no flat
 * NavHost): the persisted session decides auth-vs-portal, and small enum state machines own the
 * unauth funnel and the post-login gate. Every transition is explicit and every post-auth jump pops
 * its predecessor so back-press can never return to splash, landing, or an auth screen (LAW 4).
 *
 *   Splash (in App.kt)
 *     ├─ valid session → [AuthedFlow] → role gate → correct portal
 *     └─ no session    → [UnauthFlow] → CommonLanding → Parent/Admin auth
 *
 * Role is the persisted JWT role; [EntryRole] normalizes it (handles ADMIN / SCHOOL_ADMIN / TEACHER
 * / PARENT) so no decision site hardcodes a raw string.

 *  • SCHOOL_ADMIN — decided by SERVER TRUTH via `GET /api/v1/onboarding/status`
 *                   (see [OnboardingGateViewModel]). NOT the local `profile_completed`
 *                   flag. This fixes the class of bug where a manually-inserted /
 *                   hand-edited admin row reported onboarding as complete while its
 *                   `schools` row / classes did not actually exist — the admin would

 *                   also yields the first incomplete step so a partially-onboarded
 *                   admin RESUMES at the right place.
 *  • TEACHER      — `profileCompleted == false` → first-login change-password gate, else portal.
 *
 * The change-password gate (RA-54) is backed by a real `POST /auth/change-password` +
 * `must_change_password` flag.
